# Telecom Churn Prediction Project
## Overview
In the highly competitive telecom industry of the Indian and Southeast Asian market, customer retention has become a paramount concern. With an average annual churn rate of 15-25%, predicting and reducing customer churn, especially among high-value customers, is crucial for telecom companies.

This project aims to analyze customer-level data from a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify high-risk churn customers, and uncover key indicators of churn. By focusing on high-value customers, who contribute approximately 80% of the revenue, the objective is to minimize revenue leakage through targeted interventions.

## Project Structure
1. Problem Statement: Understanding the challenges in the telecom industry and the significance of predicting customer churn.

2. Data Understanding and Definitions: Clarifying the definition of churn, focusing on the usage-based definition, and emphasizing the importance of the prepaid model in the Indian and Southeast Asian market.

3. Business Objective and Data Description: Outlining the objective of predicting churn in the ninth month using data from the preceding three months and explaining the customer lifecycle phases.

4. Data Dictionary: Providing a link to download the dataset and the data dictionary for reference.

5. Data Preparation Steps: Deriving new features, filtering high-value customers, tagging churners, and removing attributes of the churn phase.

6. Modelling Approach: Preprocessing data, handling missing values, and conducting exploratory analysis. Deriving new features for improved model performance. Reducing variables using PCA and handling class imbalance. Training a variety of models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests) and evaluating them based on appropriate metrics. Building a secondary model to identify important predictor attributes.

7. Conclusion and Recommendations: Summarizing the findings from the models and recommending strategies to manage customer churn based on observations.
